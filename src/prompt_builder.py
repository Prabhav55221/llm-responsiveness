You have just read the thread above, and are trying to decide what you think about the final post.
You happen to see the following COMMENT 1 on another website.

{comment1_section}

You also happen to see this other COMMENT 2 on a different website.

{comment2_section}

Please fill out the following JSON template, paying careful attention to the wording of the{p0_humor_text} final post, the{p1_humor_text} COMMENT 1 and the{p2_humor_text} COMMENT 2.

{{
"topicality_reasoning": <UP TO TWO SENTENCES>,
"topicality_comparison": <NUMBER FROM 1 TO 2>,
"novelty_reasoning": <UP TO TWO SENTENCES>,
"novelty_comparison": <NUMBER FROM 1 TO 2>,
"added_value_reasoning": <UP TO TWO SENTENCES>
"added_value_comparison": <NUMBER FROM 1 TO 2>,
}}

where
* "topicality_reasoning": Compare whether COMMENT 1 or COMMENT 2 is more topical to the final post. Answer in **up to two sentences** about what Topics, Views, Claims, Evidence, or Reasoning are present in COMMENT 1 and COMMENT 2, and which one is more likely to have been part of a short conversation about the final post's topic? This does not take into account agreement, for a COMMENT that ultimately disagrees with the final post could still be highly topical if it was precisely addressing the concerns expressed in the final post.

* "topicality_comparison": Given your thought process, answer with a 1 if you think COMMENT 1 is more precisely topical to the subject matter of the final post, and answer with a 2 if you think COMMENT 2 is more precisely topical to the subject matter of the final post.

* "novelty_reasoning": Compare COMMENT 1 and COMMENT 2 on how much their Topics, Views, Claims, Evidence, or Reasoning contribute **new** information or perspectives not already present in the final post? Does either COMMENT rehash all the same points as the final post, or does one COMMENT offer a truly original perspective on the final post's topic? Answer in **up to two sentences**.

* "novelty_comparison": Given your thought process, answer with a 1 if you think COMMENT 1 presents more novel contributions to the subject matter of the final post, and answer with a 2 if you think COMMENT 2 presents more novel contributions to the subject matter of the final post.

* "added_value_reasoning": Considering your known interests as a social media user, compare your appreciation for reading COMMENT 1 vs COMMENT 2 at this time. Answer in **up to two sentences** whether you think each COMMENT added value to the conversation by being precisely **topical** to the final post and **also** making new high-quality contributions. The new high-quality contributions can be either in support of or in opposition to the final post, and both are equally valuable, though a well-articulated and insightful disagreement can often be more valuable than a well-formed supporting comment. If you think that one of the COMMENTS is not particularly substantive, interesting or informative, incorporate this into your analysis.

* "added_value_comparison": Given your thought process, answer with a 1 if you would have appreciated reading COMMENT 1 **more** than COMMENT 2 after reading the final post, and answer with a 2 if you would have appreciated reading COMMENT 2 **more** than COMMENT 1 after reading the final post."""
