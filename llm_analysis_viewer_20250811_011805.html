                    <div class="post-content"> It’s interesting in reading these comments how many people believe they know the absolute right thing Gates needs to do with her money. And whatever she IS doing with her money I guess deserves no recognition until she … reverses Citizens United, takes care of issues with boys, sets up a fund to get people out of debt, pays off the mortgages of an entire town, focuses on a specific country, gives money to veterinary schools. “If she really wanted to make a difference she would….”. It is a subtle form of denigration and I don’t think people would be doing it if the interview had been with a man. I’ve certainly never seen it. And it strikes a chord with me because I’ve personally put up with for decades. I’m a 67-year old female engineer who (among other things) works on programs that support women and people of color in STEM fields. But, if I “really wanted to change things I would ……” What I can say to all these people who have some better idea for what Gates needs to do with her money and time… go do that thing yourself. There is so much to be done. You do it. </div>

                            COMMENT 1 is more topical as it directly addresses the dismissal of Melinda Gates' work and clarifies the nature of her philanthropy, which aligns with the final post's defense against unfair criticism and mischaracterization of her efforts. COMMENT 2, while positive, is a general statement of praise that doesn't engage with the specific issue of criticism or its gendered aspect, which are central to the final post.

                            COMMENT 1 offers novel contributions by suggesting that criticism might stem from superficial judgment ('one sighting') and by clarifying that Gates' work focuses on 'policies and resources that will empower' rather than direct 'rescuing.' This adds specific details about the nature of both the criticism and Gates' actual work, which were not explicitly detailed in the final post. COMMENT 2, conversely, offers a high-level opinion without providing new information or specific insights into the Gates' work or the context of the discussion.

                            As a social media user seeking to understand the world, I would appreciate COMMENT 1 more because it is both highly topical and provides specific, new information that deepens my understanding of the dynamics of the criticism and the actual scope of Gates' philanthropy. COMMENT 2, while positive, is less substantive and doesn't contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the issues raised by the final post.

                            Both comments add value to the conversation by providing perspectives on different aspects of racism and denial of war crimes. However, COMMENT 1's focus on the persistence of racism in America is more relevant and insightful as it directly addresses a point made in the final post.

As long as papers like NYTimes (arguably this country's foremost newspaper) continue to use such poor judgement in putting mostly stories critical of Biden above the fold and declining to place stories critical of Trump in top billing at the same rate, we are likely to see a second Trump presidency. Because the Times is going to do the same thing with Harris that they are doing with Biden. I would love to see a perfect presidential candidate, but there is no such thing. 
In summary, you may be right, but I think your focus is off. There are bigger issues than Biden right now. And the New York Times is one of them.</div>

                    <div class="post-content">This is why Harris was such a bad pick for such an aged (yes, decent and good, but super elderly) President. She is not the one. \n\nPrior to this recent public reminder that Biden is very very old, and showing it more by the day, Democratic advisers and policy gurus were also pushing some unwise and unpopular things, notably failing to limit illegal migration, a bipartisan issue. That alone could cost the election, plus the circular firing squad for Gaza. In addition there are other real probs people don\u2019t mention as much - like the management of the Afghanistan withdrawal crisis (a true tragedy and largely forgotten, except maybe by GWT veterans.) \n\nBiden did a lot of good things. But he was supposed to be caretaker one term statesman. \n\n Trump is an agent of chaos (and pretty crazy\u2026) and could be easily defeated by a competent, younger Democratic politician with policy views in line with center and center left individuals necessary to be electable via electoral college. \n\nThe Democrats are often goofy. Pick a 4 main plank platform based on economic justice and fairness, managed pro labor capitalism, environment and a strong defense. Address the rest after election. \n\nApparently that was too much to ask for.</div>

                    <div class="post-content">Our country is so sad. Hillary was a sharp debater, but we see how much that helped. Biden has, in my estimation, always been a lackluster public speaker. His strengths lie elsewhere, so his accomplishments should be hammered home in every other possible venue (as debates aren't gonna be the best format). We are a reality TV culture and need everyone to be polished (but don't look like you are trying) performers, who always project your correct brand. You must appear a certain way (one dimensional) rather than BE a certain way as a rounded human. I am sad that when far too many people see T, they like it. How do you convince people who like this kind of character to look deeper or differently? Just by throwing up another candidate that is shinier?

Please, instead of constantly referring to Biden's age - and seeing every perceived fault through this one characteristic - can we focus on content? I am disturbed but not surprised by the full-on ageism on display. When Biden does good things, why are these accomplishments not assigned to his age and long experience and wisdom? Only the flaws are chalked up to age. That's the "hyper visibility" that people of marginal groups experience all the time - if they aren't invisible.

Maybe Biden needs to not run. I don't know. But, let's be as clear as possible: he is not the problem so much as our infantile culture, a broken populace that can and does get behind T because of the most superficial reasons.</div>

                            COMMENT 1 offers a novel perspective by shifting the focus to schools teaching an 'obsession over racial identity' and blocking 'challenging arguments,' presenting a different angle on whose views are being suppressed. COMMENT 2, while illustrative, largely reinforces the final post's implied sentiment about resistance to minority voices without introducing a new analytical framework.

                            As a social media user, I would appreciate COMMENT 1 more because it offers a specific, albeit controversial, claim about educational practices and the suppression of certain viewpoints, providing a different lens through which to understand the broader issue of who can speak. COMMENT 2, while topical, is more of a sarcastic observation of a common reaction, offering less in terms of new analytical insight or a deeper understanding of the underlying dynamics.

As long as papers like NYTimes (arguably this country's foremost newspaper) continue to use such poor judgement in putting mostly stories critical of Biden above the fold and declining to place stories critical of Trump in top billing at the same rate, we are likely to see a second Trump presidency. Because the Times is going to do the same thing with Harris that they are doing with Biden. I would love to see a perfect presidential candidate, but there is no such thing. 
In summary, you may be right, but I think your focus is off. There are bigger issues than Biden right now. And the New York Times is one of them.</div>

He has a strong team around him and rather than have a circular firing squad like an open convention would provide, we must stick to that team. Get off this broken record and focus on the fact that a criminal, serial liar, and extreme bigot, could be the next president.

                    <div class="post-content">I would vote for Biden's head in a jar over Donald Trump. I remember people concerned about Ronald Reagan's mental capacity and yet he still won the presidency. So if Biden doesn't drop out and people don't band together to show up at the voting booths in November, that is Biden's fault? Not the fault of American citizens who choose to sit out this election or write in a third party candidate which could hand the presidency over to Trump? It will be a LOT easier for people to hold their nose and vote for Biden then to try to wrestle the country back from Trump and his corrupt enablers and Supreme Court justices. I pray that the the recent elections in the UK and France which pushed back on the far right will happen here. I trust both Biden and Harris (should she have to step in) and the people they hire to continue working for us and to course correct the damage the GOP and their appointed SC justices have done.\n\nTrump doesn't love that Biden is staying in the race. He loves the CHAOS that this is causing. All because of one debate and debates do not decide elections. Many candidates \"lost\" debates and went on to win the presidency. We have four months to go and a lot could happen between now and then. I suggest looking up what history professor Allan Lichtman has to say about all of this. And while it's not exactly the same, take a lesson from 1968, 1980, and 2016. When Dems don't band together behind the candidate, Republicans get elected.</div>

                            Both comments address the central theme of the original post, which is the perceived over-criticism of Biden and the potential consequences for the upcoming election. Comment 1 focuses on Biden's age and the need to unite against Trump, while Comment 2 emphasizes the importance of voting and historical precedents, making both relevant.

                            The final post argues the media's bias is the "larger issue" leading to a potential Trump presidency, while acknowledging Biden's imperfections. COMMENT 2 is more topical as it engages with the broader "bigger issues" of voter responsibility and historical election patterns that could lead to a Trump presidency, offering alternative explanations and solutions to the media's role. COMMENT 1 focuses more narrowly on defending Biden's electability despite his age.

                            COMMENT 1 largely echoes the final post’s themes (shaming the NYT, defending Biden) without adding much new evidence. COMMENT 2 introduces additional perspectives — historical comparisons, a reference to Allan Lichtman, and an explicit argument about voter behavior and responsibility — which are new relative to the final post.

As long as papers like NYTimes (arguably this country's foremost newspaper) continue to use such poor judgement in putting mostly stories critical of Biden above the fold and declining to place stories critical of Trump in top billing at the same rate, we are likely to see a second Trump presidency. Because the Times is going to do the same thing with Harris that they are doing with Biden. I would love to see a perfect presidential candidate, but there is no such thing. 
In summary, you may be right, but I think your focus is off. There are bigger issues than Biden right now. And the New York Times is one of them.</div>

I lay the blame on the media, including the NYT. This isn’t new: look at how Hillary’s “deplorables” was reported far more often than Trump’s “vermin” comment in 2016. See Thom Hartmann’s column yesterday, which cited Media Matters https://substack.com/redirect/2caa0bb3-5602-48dd-a994-66e7ffcb7b55?j=eyJ1IjoiY2F6eDkifQ.PYsrIwc8dSf2i8ktNxSd0F9Kp3Z65HIh7hMCTRjxhXk

Are they afraid of drawing more attention to it? This is the alternative to Biden at this point, in plain sight. Trump's debate performance was not dissected, simply noted as "fact-free," like who would expect more? This kind of coverage does Americans a disservice. 
Yes, we should be able to consider other Democrats at this point; balanced, critical coverage of Trump is also crucial. Your readers may be unlikely to vote for him anyway, but many are considering not voting at all; they need to know the danger he poses.

                            Comment 1 adds value by providing concrete examples and external links to support the claim of biased media coverage, which strengthens the argument made in the final post. Comment 2 is also valuable, but the focus on Plan 2025, while important, is less directly tied to the central argument about the NYT's general bias.

                            Both comments are highly topical to the final post's central claim about the New York Times' biased coverage. COMMENT 2 is slightly more precisely topical as it directly addresses the final post's implication about the lack of critical Trump coverage by providing specific current examples like Project 2025 and Trump's debate performance.

Very underrated comment.
I suppose many don’t consider the nuances of Black america.

Non FBA ( foundational black American )
Blacks routinely oppose reparations.
They also possess a different relationship to American culture at large, in that they 
often possess direct connections to “another home” . Financially, Culturally, linguistically, Familial etc.
It’s often a notable distinction.

                            Comment 1 directly addresses the claim about being silenced by tying it to schools teaching racial identity and suppressing dissent, which maps closely onto the final post's complaint.

And whatever she IS doing with her money I guess deserves no recognition until she … reverses Citizens United, takes care of issues with boys, sets up a fund to get people out of debt, pays off the mortgages of an entire town, focuses on a specific country, gives money to veterinary schools. “If she really wanted to make a difference she would….”. It is a subtle form of denigration and I don’t think people would be doing it if the interview had been with a man. I’ve certainly never seen it. And it strikes a chord with me because I’ve personally put up with for decades. I’m a 67-year old female engineer who (among other things) works on programs that support women and people of color in STEM fields. But, if I “really wanted to change things I would ……” What I can say to all these people who have some better idea for what Gates needs to do with her money and time… go do that thing yourself.

                            As a social media user seeking to broaden my perspective with intelligent analysis, COMMENT 1 offers significantly more value by providing a nuanced and insightful explanation of the complex power dynamics behind the silencing of Black voices. It moves beyond simply stating the problem to analyzing a specific mechanism, whereas COMMENT 2, while passionate, offers a more generalized strategic argument that is less directly analytical of the final post's core concern.

As long as papers like NYTimes (arguably this country's foremost newspaper) continue to use such poor judgement in putting mostly stories critical of Biden above the fold and declining to place stories critical of Trump in top billing at the same rate, we are likely to see a second Trump presidency. Because the Times is going to do the same thing with Harris that they are doing with Biden. I would love to see a perfect presidential candidate, but there is no such thing. 
In summary, you may be right, but I think your focus is off. There are bigger issues than Biden right now. And the New York Times is one of them.</div>

                    <div class="post-content">I think some of Biden's defiance comes from the lack of substantial reporting recently on his policy accomplishments and what he plans to do in a second term. If the media had been more balanced in reporting on what he is actually doing as president, rather than constantly reporting on his age and polling (and framing any policy achievement through the lens of electoral politics), he might be more interested in listening to their criticisms right now, rather than defiant. Reporting on age, polling, the debate, Gaza, etc. is fine and needed, but it's been obscenely disproportionate. What human would react to that kind of distorted representation by saying, \"You know, you're right!\"</div>

They attempted to normalize him, in some level of journalistic lack of bias. They covered him to the extreme, in some effort to gain clicks, subscribers, laughs, and profits. They downgraded his competitors, especially the respectable and respected Joe Biden. They have allowed trump profiteers such as Baker and Haberman to cover a presidential election in which they have clear selfish bias. 
On the other hand, they have given us Lydia. </div>

This provides a new psychological or behavioral dimension to the discussion of media impact.

                            As a social media user seeking to broaden my perspective, I would appreciate COMMENT 1 more because it offers an intelligent analysis of the *impact* of media behavior on a political figure's response, moving beyond just describing the bias itself. This deeper insight into the human element and consequences of media coverage provides a more valuable and thought-provoking contribution than COMMENT 2, which primarily adds more specific details to an already established point.

And whatever she IS doing with her money I guess deserves no recognition until she … reverses Citizens United, takes care of issues with boys, sets up a fund to get people out of debt, pays off the mortgages of an entire town, focuses on a specific country, gives money to veterinary schools. “If she really wanted to make a difference she would….”. It is a subtle form of denigration and I don’t think people would be doing it if the interview had been with a man. I’ve certainly never seen it. And it strikes a chord with me because I’ve personally put up with for decades. I’m a 67-year old female engineer who (among other things) works on programs that support women and people of color in STEM fields. But, if I “really wanted to change things I would ……” What I can say to all these people who have some better idea for what Gates needs to do with her money and time… go do that thing yourself.
